            Hello, my name is Robert Figgers, but I go by Mitch. I am a 27 year
            old male who currently works in the service industry, specifically
            at a restaurant named Lunch and Supper, located in Scott's Addition
            in Richmond. I am in the process of completing the University of
            Richmond web development bootcamp, and hope to start my work in the
            field when that is completed. Previously, I graduated from Virginia
            Commonwealth University with a degree in business and a focus on
            real estate. As much as I enjoyed learning about that, I decided it
            ultimately wasn't for me. In late 2021, I decided to build my first
            computer motivated by my passion for video games. I really enjoyed
            that process, although it wasn't easy. It did open my eyes to what I
            really wanted to do for my career though, and here I am today
            learning web development. It is challenging but also exciting and
            fun, and it fels like the possibilities with it are endless,
            although I just started.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As for my personal life, I enjoy doing a lot of things in my free
            time. As stated above, I really like video games, and always have a
            good time playing with friends and interacting with different
            communities through them. My favorites right now are Valorant and
            Rocket League, but also explore relaxing games such as RPGs and the
            Civilization line. I also am a theme park enthusiast. Having two
            parks, Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Kings Dominion, within a 45
            minute drive each makes that easy. Outside of those two, I have been
            to a lot of otheres. My personal favorites are Cedar Point and
            Hersehypark, but I still have a lot to go! Lastly, I do still try to
            play as much tennis as I can. I played in high school and have
            enjoyed it since. However, ever since I tore my ACL I haven't played
            as muich as I would like to.
