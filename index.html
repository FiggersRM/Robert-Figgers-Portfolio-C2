          <p>Hello, my name is Robert Figgers, but I go by Mitch. I am a 27 year old male who currently works in the service industry, specifically at a restaurant named Lunch and Supper, located in Scott's Addition in Richmond. I am in the process of completing the University of Richmond web development bootcamp, and hope to start my work in the field when that is completed. Previously, I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with a degree in business and a focus on real estate. As much as I enjoyed learning about that, I decided it ultimately wasn't for me. In late 2021, I decided to build my first computer motivated by my passion for video games. I really enjoyed that process, although it wasn't easy. It did open my eyes to what I really wanted to do for my career though, and here I am today learning web development. It is challenging but also exciting and fun, and it fels like the possibilities with it are endless, although I just started.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As for my personal life, I enjoy doing a lot of things in my free time. As stated above, I really like video games, and always have a good time playing with friends and interacting with different communities through them. My favorites right now are Valorant and Rocket League, but also explore relaxing games such as RPGs and the Civilization line. I also am a theme park enthusiast. Having two parks, Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Kings Dominion, within a 45 minute drive each makes that easy. Outside of those two, I have been to a lot of otheres. My personal favorites are Cedar Point and Hersehypark, but I still have a lot to go! Lastly, I do still try to play as much tennis as I can. I played in high school and have enjoyed it since. However, ever since I tore my ACL I haven't played as muich as I would like to.</p>
