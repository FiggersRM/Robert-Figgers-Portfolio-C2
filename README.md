# Robert-Figgers-Portfolio-C2

Portfolio for Robert Figgers

## Description

In this activity, we created a professional portfolio to represent ourselves and the applications we will make. It was a challenge for us to use Cascading Style Sheets in order to format the page and get it to look they way we would like. This included writing our html code from scratch, and then creating a CSS file in order to style the elements on the page how we would like. It also utilized flexing, so that when the page shrinks, some items would flex to columns instead of rows. In the future, this portfolio will be updated with the projects that will be completed throughout the bootcamp. In this ReadMe, you will find: the resources used to complete the task, a link to the deployed application, and a screenshot of the live website.
